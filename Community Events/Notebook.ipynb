    "Welcome to the IVCSD Community Events Data Analysis notebook. In this notebook, we will be automatically analyzing the data provided by IVCSD. All graphs generated will be saved as a picture to the `output` folder. Please run the `setup` code cell first. Then, for each analysis you want, you can simply run the corresponding code block under each heading. If you do not see the custom theme, run it again to refresh inline styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for this analysis specifically, there are many manual imports of data, as these tools have already analyzed for you. You simply need to find the correct data and report it. As such, this notebook will simply note the major sites to gather data for reporting."
